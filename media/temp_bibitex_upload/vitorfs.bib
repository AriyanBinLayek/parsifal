abstract = "Context Offshore software development outsourcing is a modern business strategy for developing high quality software at low cost. Objective The objective of this research paper is to identify and analyse factors that are important in terms of the competitiveness of vendor organisations in attracting outsourcing projects. Method We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) by applying our customised search strings which were derived from our research questions. We performed all the \{SLR\} steps, such as the protocol development, initial selection, final selection, quality assessment, data extraction and data synthesis. Results We have identified factors such as cost-saving, skilled human resource, appropriate infrastructure, quality of product and services, efficient outsourcing relationships management, and an organisation's track record of successful projects which are generally considered important by the outsourcing clients. Our results indicate that appropriate infrastructure, cost-saving, and skilled human resource are common in three continents, namely Asia, North America and Europe. We identified appropriate infrastructure, cost-saving, and quality of products and services as being common in three types of organisations (small, medium and large). We have also identified four factors-appropriate infrastructure, cost-saving, quality of products and services, and skilled human resource as being common in the two decades (1990–1999 and 2000–mid 2008). Conclusions Cost-saving should not be considered as the driving factor in the selection process of software development outsourcing vendors. Vendors should rather address other factors in order to compete in the \{OSDO\} business, such as skilled human resource, appropriate infrastructure and quality of products and services. "

In our current communication-enriched environment, best practices for coordination are adopted by all software projects yet some still fail to achieve their target performance. Does team structure have any bearing on the performance outcome of the project? How does the communication between teams and their external parties affect ultimate success or failure of projects? We seek to answer above questions by applying existing theories and analytical methods from social networks for exploring the coordination performance of defect management activities found in \{OSS\} projects. We propose social networks based theoretical model for exploring distributed coordination structure and apply that for the case of \{OSS\} defect management process for exploring the structural properties, which induce the greatest coordination performance. The outcome of our suggest that there is correlation between certain network measures such as density, centrality and betweenness and coordination performance measures of defect management systems such as quality and timeliness.

A formal, quantitative methodology for time variant analysis of the transcripts of global software student teams based on content analysis is established. Results from the analysis suggest a positive correlation between a team’s temporal communication patterns and project outcomes as well as a relationship between variations in communication behaviors and different phases of the software development cycle. The research also found that the temporal variations in communication behaviors between software phases were similar for the two projects.

Our findings indicated that trust had a significant effect on project quality but little on cost adherence; the relationship between control and the two vendor performance measures were the opposite of this. Furthermore, information sharing, communication quality, and inter-firm adaptation emerged as three significant contributors to the vendor's trust in the client; goal setting and cultural blending turned out to be significant in influencing the client's control over the vendor. One of the key contributions and implications of our research was that certain offshore client behaviors could shape vendor performance by influencing the vendor's trust in the client and client's control over the vendor, beyond formal contracts.

Tools as questionnaires, focus groups sessions and operations strategy planning techniques were utilized in this research aiming to measure the level of comprehension of such performance measures in different teams and identify factors that may improve their performance. This methodology was applied on 3 sites, in different countries and under the same management guidelines. The impact of subjective items as behavior over performance measurement systems is evident. Lack of clear communication, language barriers, miscomprehension of the objectives and cultural barriers negatively increase the impact of behavior on performance measurement. The identification and correction of these items is crucial for the success of a team. "

The connection to a server, however, was made deliberately error-prone, leading to occasional losses of network connections. Consequently, participants were not provided with real-time situation updates. To deal with this problem we equipped team members with a network-aware application that signaled network loss to them and adapted the graphical representation of the location of fellow team members accordingly to the quality of location information present. The experiment revealed that presenting complete and reliable geospatial information improves teamwork. Teams connected to a server over a fast and reliable link showed superior performance over teams with no network connection whatsoever to a server. The present study failed, however, to demonstrate the added value of network-aware support when teams had to collaborate in the presence of an unreliable communications infrastructure. Although participants indicated a slight preference for the network-aware application over a condition without support signaling network loss, no differences were observed in team process and outcome measures.

The virtual team, via various computer-based media (e.g. email, groupware) and noncomputer-based media (e.g. telephone), can interact and collaborate though separated by distance and time. One approach to their study is determining whether factors that drive conventional team performance also exist in the virtual environment. Interaction style has been shown to have a great effect on conventional teams' ability to achieve solution quality and solution acceptance on collaborative decision tasks (Hirokawa, 1985; Watson &amp; Michaelsen 1988; Hirokawa &amp; Gouran, 1989; Cooke &amp; Szumal, 1994). Group interaction styles affect communication and thus team performance by facilitating or hindering the exchange of information among group members. These styles reflect an aggregation of behavioral traits of individual team members, rooted in their individual personalities. The interaction style of conventional teams can be reliably assessed, and from that assessment, performance on collaborative decision tasks can be predicted. This study investigated whether or not virtual teams who collaborate via computer-mediated communication also exhibit similar interaction styles, and whether the styles have the same effects on their decision performance and process outcomes as they do with conventional teams. Members of 42 virtual teams completed an intellective decision first individually and then collaboratively. Post-task measures captured individual and team performance data (e.g. solution quality) as well as process perceptions (individual acceptance of the team solution). An additional post-task tool was able to accurately capture the teams' interaction style. Results show that the interaction styles of virtual teams affect both performance and process outcomes in ways that are directionally consistent with those exhibited by conventional face-to-face teams. Implications include recommending the methodology for virtual team management, and suggestions for future research are offered. "

From this, a fuzzy multiattribute decision analysis (MADA) approach based on the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model is proposed to measure the performances on reputation and collaboration. By the measurements of the performances, the trust level of each member and the virtual team can be identified so as to improve the management of the virtual team. Furthermore, a Web-based trust estimation system (WTES) is designed and developed to support the activities of trust estimation in a virtual team. Finally, an application is provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed decision support method. "

Solutions to trust formation problems need to be based on an understanding of how interpersonal trust forms in face-to-face project teams as well as on insight into how this process differs in virtual teams. Synthesizing literature from various disciplines, we propose a model for the formation of interpersonal trust between project team members. Taking this model as a starting point, we analyse how virtual settings may alter or even obstruct the process of trust formation. One method to improve the formation of interpersonal trust in virtual settings is to facilitate the assessment of trustworthiness. This can be done by making information available about individual virtual project team members. Previous research in virtual project teams focussed principally on the medium by which information is spread, for example, by phone, mail, or videoconferencing. Most researchers failed to take the specific content of the information into account, although there is general agreement that personal, non-task-related information is important to foster trust. For this, we propose to use the antecedents of trustworthiness, which until now have mainly been used as a framework to measure trust, as a design framework instead. This framework of antecedents can also be used to determine which type of information is relevant to assess each other’s trustworthiness. We review existing literature on the antecedents of trustworthiness and extend the well-accepted antecedents of ‘ability’, ‘benevolence’ and ‘integrity’ with several other antecedents, such as ‘communality’ and ‘accountability’. Together, these form the TrustWorthiness \{ANtecedents\} (TWAN) schema. We describe how these antecedents can be used to determine which information is relevant for team members assessing others’ trustworthiness. In future research we will first verify this extended cognitive schema of trustworthiness (TWAN) empirically and then apply it to the design of artefacts or guidelines, such as a personal identity profile to support the assessment of trustworthiness in virtual project teams.

A service-based \{TCN\} implementation has been applied in eleven distributed engineering design projects to support in the assessment of communication patterns and to provide a live view into the online communication activities of conceptual design teams. The key findings of this pilot application are presented. "

It presents where information was stored; what information was stored; when and how. Qualitative and quantitative research methods are outlined along with results. Numerous issues are identified and discussed, establishing that there is need for more prescriptive measures to support distributed design information management. The paper concludes by presenting a series of recommendations concerning the emergent themes of information storing; information storing systems; information storing patterns; and information strategy.

abstract = "Publisher Summary It is apparent that a broad range of factors can increase innovation in teams. It appears that with the right people, the right supporting, motivational and task contexts, and effective social and cognitive processes, teams can be highly innovative. This outcome is probably not surprising and to some extent states the obvious. Such excellence may not be inevitable in teams, since this configuration adds a level of complexity. Team members have to coordinate effectively, efficiently and adequately share and combine their relevant knowledge, select the best ideas, and effectively implement them. It may take considerable training and experience for teams to excel at team creativity. There is a need for studies that provide objective measures of processes and outcomes in real world settings with appropriate comparison groups. Laboratory studies of creativity in short-term groups suggest that groups will often under perform and will exceed non-interactive baselines only under conditions that are optimal for group idea exchange. However, the fact that laboratory studies have been able to find synergy with ad-hoc groups in short-term settings suggests that teams which involve members suited for teamwork, who have worked together for some time and have the diverse perspectives needed for a problem, should also be able to achieve synergistic outcomes under the right conditions. Laboratory research on group creativity and field research on innovation in work teams are reviewed and integrated. Although there are some limitations to each of these traditions, they provide a fairly coherent perspective on collaborative creativity. A wide variety of factors have been found to facilitate creative collaboration. We highlight a range of social and cognitive factors that are important in collaborative creativity, and present a comprehensive model of processes involved in collaborative creativity. Some studies on group creativity in the laboratory have been able to demonstrate that collaborative creativity leads to superior outcomes in comparison to individual creativity. Research on team innovation has not yet allowed a determination of this issue for work teams. However, the literature has provided a strong empirical and theoretical foundation for enhancing innovation in organizations. "

However, successful collaborative product design depends on the ability to effectively manage and share engineering knowledge and data throughout the entire product development process. Co-design software platforms aim to facilitate cooperation in distributed teams. In the context of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) the advanced co-design software implementation to support the supply chain is not a trivial task. \{SMEs\} have peculiar characteristics such as flexibility, \{ICT\} skills and financial resources, which are difficult to be integrated within a structured design network. This paper presents a method to define and evaluate a co-design platform dedicated to \{SMEs\} in the mechanical product field. System architecture is defined by applying suitable metrics based on collaborative process characteristics in order to assess functionality performance of the available tools. Benchmarking is based on different levels of collaboration recognized in the typical product development process in SMEs. Correlation between process metrics, software functionalities and specific collaboration requirements is managed by adopting Quality Function Deployment (QFD) techniques. A practical case study allows the robustness of the proposed method to be verified and the main advantages and future developments to be discussed. "

In the last five&#xa0;years, camera traps have made the transition to digital technology, where these devices now produce hundreds of instantly available images per month and a large amount of ancillary metadata (e.g., date, time, temperature, image size, etc.). Despite this accelerated pace in the development of digital image capture, field biologists still lack adequate software solutions to process and manage the increasing amount of information in a cost efficient way. In this paper we describe a software system that we have developed, called DeskTEAM, to address this issue. DeskTEAM has been developed in the context of the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring Network (TEAM), a global network that monitors terrestrial vertebrates. We describe the software architecture and functionality and its utility in managing and processing large amounts of digital camera trap data collected throughout the global \{TEAM\} network. DeskTEAM incorporates software features and functionality that make it relevant to the broad camera trapping community. These include the ability to run the application locally on a laptop or desktop computer, without requiring an Internet connection, as well as the ability to run on multiple operating systems; an intuitive navigational user interface with multiple levels of detail (from individual images, to whole groups of images) which allows users to easily manage hundreds or thousands of images; ability to automatically extract \{EXIF\} and custom metadata information from digital images to increase standardization; availability of embedded taxonomic lists to allow users to easily tag images with species identities; and the ability to export data packages consisting of data, metadata and images in standardized formats so that they can be transferred to online data warehouses for easy archiving and dissemination. Lastly, building these software tools for wildlife scientists provides valuable lessons for the ecoinformatics community. "

Additionally, we addressed how metacognitive processes interact with learning outcomes when training for complex synthetic task environments. We find first, that multiple methods of assessing problem solving performance are diagnostic of knowledge acquisition for a complex synthetic team task, and second, that general metacomprehension predisposition is related to metacomprehension accuracy in synthetic task environments.

Teams working in the sophisticated communication environment collaborated from separate locations over a networked computer system allowing them to share a note-taking program, work in parallel, and exchange in real-time audio as well as video. Results revealed detrimental effects of time pressure on both team processes and outcomes, and supported our hypothesis that distributed teams can perform as well as FtF teams. No differences were found between FtF teams and teams working in the sophisticated communication environment on process and outcome measures, except for the quantity of performance: The sophisticated communication environment enabled distributed teams to work on the task more rapidly than their FtF counterparts. Radio teams produced plans of lower quality and were less satisfied with the quality of their planning process than FtF teams. "

As the activity and the modelling tools are aimed for general use, although focused on \{ITER\} plasmas, a device independent approach to data transport and a standardized approach to data management (data structures, naming, and access) is being developed in order to allow cross-validation between different fusion devices using a single toolset. Extensive work has already gone into, and is continuing to go into, the development of standardized descriptions of the data (Consistent Physical Objects). The longer term aim is a complete simulation platform which is expected to last and be extended in different ways for the coming 30 years. The technical underpinning is therefore of vital importance. In particular the platform needs to be extensible and open-ended to be able to take full advantage of not only today's most advanced technologies but also be able to marshal future developments. As a full level comprehensive prediction of \{ITER\} physics rapidly becomes expensive in terms of computing resources, the simulation framework needs to be able to use both grid and \{HPC\} computing facilities. Hence data access and code coupling technologies are required to be available for a heterogeneous, possibly distributed, environment. The developments in this area are pursued in a separate project—EUFORIA (EU Fusion for \{ITER\} Applications) which is providing about 15 professional person year (ppy) per annum from 14 different institutes. The range and size of the activity is not only technically challenging but is providing some unique management challenges in that a large and geographically distributed team (a truly pan-European set of researchers) need to be coordinated on a fairly detailed project level. The 2009 Work programme of ITM-TF organizes 240 individuals from 24 different associations providing about 60&#xa0;ppy in total. Remote participation and collaborative tools and facilities as the \{ENEA\} sponsored Gateway have proven indispensible to meet this challenge.The current status of ITM-TF and \{EUFORIA\} is presented and discussed.

According to a research conducted in Turkish construction industry, most of the problems that occur during the construction phase are due to lack of co-operation and communication between designers and contractors and lack of prompt expert decisions during on-site engineering. Similar to any major construction project, tunnelling project’s success is highly dependent on collaborative team work where communication and information exchange take place between project members. Distributed collaborative teamwork, as the case in most of the large scale construction projects as well as tunnelling projects, empowered by state of the art information and communication technology, promises more efficient work processes, reduced travelling needs, and increased opportunities for project communication. Following the fast development of mobile computing in recent years, many sectors have adopted mobile devices and wireless technologies enabling real-time information transfer thereby improving business processes. For some years, the feasibility of implementing wireless solutions to construction sites has been researched. Potentially, mobile and wireless technologies enable construction staff to be more flexible in terms of location and time. For better use of mobile collaboration in construction projects, mobile technologies and construction sector have to be examined in some detail to implant the most suitable technology for real-time information access and improved collaboration of distributed teams in construction. However, case studies in construction are very limited in number and scope. This paper discusses and proposes an implementation scenario of wireless networking in Marmaray; a multi-site tunnelling project in Istanbul. Benefits, possible problems and cost assessments are discussed. "
